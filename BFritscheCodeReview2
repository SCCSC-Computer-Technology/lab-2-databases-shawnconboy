Hello, Shawn, after looking over your code, I can say with confidence that you put a lot of effort and work into it. The GUI is very well organized
and all of the buttons perform the functions they are supposed to. Your code is also organized well and documented well, with
comments explaining what each button does. A thing you did differently from me is that you chose to display the stats in a label, whereas I displayed
mine within a message-box. Your data functions for average, ascending, etc. are also well made and similar to how I made mine. I don't have any
further observations or questions about the code, good work overall.

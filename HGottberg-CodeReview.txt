Heinrich Gottberg Code Review of ShawnConboy Lab 2

Is the code generally readable and well-documented?

	Yes, there are comments detailing the different functions. The code is well 	organized and no obvious blank space.

Did you find any software defects?

	No, the program ran as expected. The database imported all the data 	accurately.

What was one way that their solution differed from yours?

	Shawn used labels while I used message boxes. Overall the program achieves 	the same functionality as mine.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

	You could work on your GUI, but as long as it functions. This lab doesn't 	require the most comprehensive GUI.

This is a solid program, with more time it could be spiced up in the visual department but we aren't running a beauty contest. Good work.

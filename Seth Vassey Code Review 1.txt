Hello Shawn, You did good on this project. I found your application to be well structured and easy to follow. The layout of the form is clean, and each button clearly does what it is intended to do without any confusion. I also appreciated the comments throughout the code, which made it easier to understand the logic behind each event handler. I love that the colors aren't all over the place and it is just plane and simple.

One difference between your approach and mine is how you chose to display the some of the results inside of labels .My project differed from that because I handled those results directly within the table. Your approach works well because it separates summary information from the main data view, which can improve readability for users. I just feel that in the future (Even though it may be a lot of buttons) just try to keep everything withing the data view. Great job!
